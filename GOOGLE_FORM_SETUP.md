# Google Form Integration Setup

To connect this POS system to a Google Form, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a Google Form

1. Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)
2. Create a new form
3. Add the following fields:
   - **Staff Name** (Short answer text)
   - **Total Amount** (Short answer text)
   - **Item Count** (Short answer text)
   - **Items** (Paragraph text)
   - **Timestamp** (Short answer text)

## 2. Get the Form URL

1. In your Google Form, click the "Send" button
2. Click the link icon (ðŸ”—)
3. Copy the form URL - it should look like:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/formResponse
   ```

## 3. Update the Code

1. Open `src/components/MainPage.js`
2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   const GOOGLE_FORM_URL = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/formResponse';
   ```
3. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID from the URL

## 4. Get Entry IDs (Optional)

For more precise form submission, you can get the entry IDs:

1. In your Google Form, right-click and "Inspect Element"
2. Look for input fields with names like `entry.123456789`
3. Update the form data in `MainPage.js` to use these specific entry IDs

## 5. Test the Integration

1. Start the React app: `npm start`
2. Login with password "1234"
3. Enter a staff name
4. Add items to cart
5. Submit the order
6. Check your Google Form responses

## Current Implementation

The current implementation simulates the form submission. To enable real Google Form submission, uncomment the fetch code in the `handleSubmit` function in `MainPage.js`.

## Form Fields Mapping

- `entry.staff_name` â†’ Staff Name
- `entry.total_amount` â†’ Total Amount  
- `entry.item_count` â†’ Item Count
- `entry.items` â†’ Items (formatted as "Item xQuantity - $Price")
- `entry.timestamp` â†’ Timestamp
